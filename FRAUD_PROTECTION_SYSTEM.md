## üîç Fraud Detection Algorithms

### Job Fraud Scoring System

```typescript
const detectJobFraud = (jobData) => {
  let fraudScore = 0;
  const flags = [];
  
  // Title Analysis (30 points)
  if (suspiciousTitles.includes(jobData.title)) {
    fraudScore += 30;
    flags.push('Suspicious job title');
  }
  
  // Description Analysis (20 points)
  if (suspiciousRequirements.includes(jobData.description)) {
    fraudScore += 20;
    flags.push('Suspicious requirements');
  }
  
  // Salary Analysis (25 points)
  if (unrealisticSalary(jobData.salary)) {
    fraudScore += 25;
    flags.push('Suspicious salary range');
  }
  
  // Urgency Analysis (15 points)
  if (jobData.isUrgent && !jobData.isVerified) {
    fraudScore += 15;
    flags.push('Unverified urgent posting');
  }
  
  // Company Info Analysis (10 points)
  if (missingCompanyInfo(jobData.company)) {
    fraudScore += 10;
    flags.push('Missing company information');
  }
  
  return { score: Math.min(fraudScore, 100), flags };
};
```

### Risk Levels
- **0-39**: Low Risk (Green) - Approved automatically
- **40-69**: Medium Risk (Yellow) - Manual review required
